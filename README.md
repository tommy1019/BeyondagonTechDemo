Real time implementation of the Beyondagon model format.

From Beyondagon README:
#Beyondagon

A model format for infinite resoultion 3d models.

This allows for models that can be defined in small files that can be expanded at real time to any resoultion. This allows fo reffects such as lowering the amount of polygons as the frame rate lowers, or increasing the polygon count as models get closer to the screen.

The model format uses beizer surfaces to define a model.
